            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I started my coding journey in high school, back in 2010.  My first language was C, and my first project was working with a team to program a small robot for the 2010 MIT Zero Robotics competition.  Our team took fourth place nationally, and our code was even executed on the ISS for the final showdown!</p>
            <p>After that, I went to college and took several coding related courses, in which I became familiar with the C++, Java, and Python languages.  Object oriented programming was a bit of a paradigm shift for me coming from C, but I've come to enjoy the structure.</p>
            <p>During my career, I've spent a good deal of time coding as a hobby on the side for various small projects, and I've found a good deal of applications for the AHK and VBA scripting languages.  This was when I was introduced to Node.js, and I instantly fell in love with javascript (ES6 is a life saver).</p>
            <p>In 2020 I was approached at work to try to develop a web app for the company, and I found that I had a bit of a talent for programming, and really enjoyed the work.  I went ahead and learned </p>
            <p>As a result, I decided to dig in and take the 2021 U of U Coding Bootcamp course, in which I'm currently learning something new every week!</p>
